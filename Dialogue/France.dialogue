Guard: Bonjour, traveler! I see you’ve come to rescue your fox from the top of our magnificent Eiffel Tower. A challenge worthy of a true hero!
- Yeah, but it looks taller than I expected. How do I get up there?
Guard: Ah, oui! The tower is 1,665 steps high. It was built for the 1889 World’s Fair, you know. Quite the symbol of love now, perfect for your quest!
- Love’s great, but I need to save her fast. Got any tips?
Guard: Of course! In Paris, we believe a full stomach leads to a strong heart. Take this croissant—it’ll give you the energy you need for the climb!"
- "Thanks, I’ll need it!"
Guard: "And remember, in France, we say ‘l’amour triomphe de tout’—love conquers all. Keep that in mind, and you’ll be at the top before you know it. Bonne chance!
- Love conquers all, huh? I’ll hold onto that. Time to get climbing!

Fox: You made it! I knew you’d come for me.
- Of course. They say 'l’amour triomphe de tout'—love conquers all. And I wasn’t about to let anything stop me.
Fox: Looks like they were right. Now let’s get out of here, together.
