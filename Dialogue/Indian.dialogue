- Yes, I’m trying to find my way out of this jungle. Any tips for getting there safely?
Maya: I’ve been following the road, just like Aryan suggested. It’s a bit challenging, but it’s the most direct route. The jungle is beautiful, though—it has its own way of guiding you if you pay attention.
- Do you know much about the dangers here?

- Have you seen any tigers yet?
Maya: Not yet, but I’ve seen signs of their presence. I keep my distance and stay alert. If you’re cautious and follow the river, you should be fine. We might even spot some together.
